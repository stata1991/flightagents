- **Transportation planning**: Suggest car rental for national park access
- **Logic**: 
  - Search flights to SFO/SJC
  - Include car rental recommendations
  - Plan driving route from airport to destination
  - Consider seasonal road conditions for national parks

**Implementation Notes**:
- Update `destination_specialist.md` to include airport proximity analysis
- Enhance `flight_search_agent.md` to prioritize airports with high flight availability
- Add transportation planning logic to `itinerary-agent.md`

  - Show "Let's begin the chat" prompt
  - Pre-populate destination in chat interface
  - Streamline the planning process

**Implementation Notes**:
- Update chat interface to handle pre-selected destinations
- Add destination pre-population logic
- Enhance chat flow for known destinations
